# Getting Started

This is a quick guide to the steps you need to take to get your app connected to the Telos Cloud Wallet in less than five minutes.

:::info
The following information is extracted from the [OreIdAuth class](https://github.com/telosnetwork/telos-wallet/blob/develop/src/antelope/wallets/authenticators/OreIdAuth.ts), which implements all the examples presented in this document.
:::

## Prerequisites

Before getting started you must set up an app with ORE ID through a specific login process to ensure your app will be created in the Telos ecosystem.  

:::danger
If you sign up or create an app through different links you will not be a part of the Telos ORE ID group and your users will not be able to access your app
::: 

To create an app on **Telos EVM**: Click [here](https://oreid.io/developer/partner/new-app?app-group-id=7ec2bdfa-4f3a-47dd-86cd-760c8d905e98) to do so.  
To create an app on **Telos Zero**: Click [here](https://oreid.io/developer/partner/new-app?app-group-id=native7d-aa42-4477-8f15-4e42ae14b937) to do so.  

For a step by step guide on how to create an account, set up an app, and access your developer dashboard see ORE ID's [docs](https://docs.oreid.io/ore-id/blockchains/telos-cloud-wallet/quickstart).

### Installation

For this integration, you will need the `oreid-js` and `oreid-webpopup` packages, which you can install with yarn:

```bash
yarn add oreid-js oreid-webpopup
```

### Importing Required Dependencies

To start, you will need to import the necessary utilities and types from the `oreid-js` package:

```typescript
import { AuthProvider, ChainNetwork, OreId, OreIdOptions, JSONObject, UserChainAccount } from 'oreid-js';
import { WebPopup } from 'oreid-webpopup';
```

### Initialize the library

First, we need to set the configuration to initialize the library. You can specify the app credentials like this:

```typescript
const oreIdOptions: OreIdOptions = {
    plugins: { popup: WebPopup() },
    appName: process.env.APP_NAME as string,
    appId: process.env.APP_OREID_APP_ID as string,
};

oreId = new OreId(oreIdOptions);
await oreId.init();

// here the oreId is ready to use 
```

In the appId property, you need to specify the id from your app configuration which can be similar to `"t_a4d1e1d175197b379929233ec8c42244"` for test nets or `"p_9233ec919741d18c75a4d4e92b374221"` for main nets.

### Authenticating the user

Once the OreId library is initialized successfully, you can open a popup window to authenticate the user using one of the many available providers for the cloud. In this example, we are using `"google"`, which is currently the only available provider.


```typescript
// popup a window to login the user
await oreId.popup.auth({ provider: "google" as AuthProvider });

// after success you will get the user data from this path
const userData = await oreId.auth.user.getData();
console.log('userData', userData);
```

### Sending Tokens

Once your user is authenticated you can try to send some TLOS tokens as follows:

```typescript
const transaction = await oreId.createTransaction({
    transaction: {
        from,
        to,
        value,
    },
    chainAccount: from,
    chainNetwork: ChainNetwork.TelosEvmTest, // or ChainNetwork.TelosEvmMain
    signOptions: {
        broadcast: true,                     // to effectively send the transaction
        returnSignedTransaction: true,       // to get a response after transaction execution
    },
});
const { transactionId } = await oreId.popup.sign({ transaction });
console.log('transaction hash:', transactionId);
```

If you need to implement a **signed interaction** with some specific contract, then you may find very useful the [next chapter](https://ore-id.telos-docs.pages.dev/evm/cloud-wallet/transactions-and-broadcasting) in which we show how to implement the most common actions requiring user's signing like sending tokens, staking, and wrapping.

However, if you need to read some information from a specific contract, you won't need to interact with the OreId library at all.
That kind of non-signed interactions are made using a JsonRpcProvider class and we explain with some examples in [this chapter](https://ore-id.telos-docs.pages.dev/evm/cloud-wallet/reading-contracts-data).
