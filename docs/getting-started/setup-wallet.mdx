# Creating A Wallet

To get started in the Telos ecosystem youâ€™ll need a cryptocurrency wallet. A wallet allows you to securely store your assets and interact with dApps (Decentralized Applications) within the Telos ecosystem.

**Some popular wallet choices are:**

- Telos Cloud Wallet (Telos EVM / Telos Zero)
- Metamask (Telos EVM)
- Anchor (Telos Zero - More on this later)
- SafePal (Telos EVM)

## Using Telos Cloud Wallet

The new [Telos Cloud Wallet](https://hellotelos.medium.com/telos-foundation-and-aikon-ore-id-announce-the-launch-of-telos-cloud-wallet-474cb07fd025) allows a traditional Web 2.0 login that promptly establishes a non-custodial wallet for the user allowing for web3 wallet functionality (Login with your google account, twitch account, etc!). Pairing it with the [Telos Web Wallet](https://wallet.telos.net/) allows you to connect your wallet and provides a sleek UI and user experience for all your Telos needs. It functions with both Telos EVM and Telos Zero.

To set up an account with Telos Cloud Wallet, head over to the [Telos Web Wallet](https://wallet.telos.net/) and select the Telos Cloud Wallet. This will walk you through a quick account set up. When setting up an account, it will ask you to create a pin. Be sure to remember the pin or write it down for safe keeping as you will need it to use the wallet.


## Using MetaMask

First, if you dont already have MetaMask installed, follow [this](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531) tutorial
