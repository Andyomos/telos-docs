# Using Telos dApps

Now that you have a wallet and some TLOS tokens, it’s time to explore the Telos Ecosystem! Check out our [Telos ecosystem page](https://www.telos.net/ecosystem?tab=evm) to find a comprehensive list of dApps.

Most dApps will have a “connect” wallet button located somewhere on the apps page, select this and connect using your newly created Telos Wallet!
