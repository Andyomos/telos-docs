# Fees

Currently, Telos Zero transactions have no fees. Telos Zero fees are set by block producers and voted by token holders.

EVM transactions will have a fee model similar to [the native Ethereum gas model](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/). The Ethereum account needs to have TLOS token to pay for the transaction. [Telos EVM fees](../../evm/about/gas-fees.md) are expected to be < 0.1% of Ethereum gas fees for identical transactions.
