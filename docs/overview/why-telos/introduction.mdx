# Introduction

Telos stands out for its minimal conflict of interest, thanks to its widespread token distribution. This quality positions it as an excellent choice for fostering collaboration among both major and minor players within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Moreover, Telos mitigates the risks associated with centralization, such as potential government interventions and founder abandonment. Telos builds its innovation upon the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, originally derived from Block.one's EOS blockchain. Notable attributes of Telos include its matured system, the decentralization of stakeholders and validators, and a well-established on-chain governance model.

## Maturity

Telos has been continuously operating since 2018 having successfully produced over 300 million blocks! Illustrating the robustness of the underlying technology stack and block producer community.

## Decentralization

Telos is a fair-distribution chain. The original TLOS token distribution was made as wide as possible to ensure that Telos blockchain stays conflict-free and a community-led effort. More information about the fair distribution model can be found in the original [Telos Whitepaper.](https://telos.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Telos-Whitepaper-master-20180717.pdf)

A review of the top 30 individually-owned accounts on Telos (April 2, 2021), excluding chain- and exchange-owned acounts, reveals that the top accounts comprise &lt;15% of the total current token-supply of the chain.

Telos token holders can be found on [TELOSTRACKER](https://telostracker.io/topHolders). Telos has a maximum supply cap. The current Telos inflation parameters can be changed by TLOS token holders through governance, but the maximum supply cap cannot be changed. Currently Telos has no inflation set. TLOS ERC-20 token accounts were not considered in the top 30.
