# TLOS Token

TLOS, the native currency of the Telos Network, plays a pivotal role in various aspects of the ecosystem. Its significance spans network governance, staking, gas fees, resource allocation, and participation in on-chain decision-making.

# Utility

- **Governance:** TLOS is the primary token for network governance. It empowers token holders to influence decisions and vote on critical network upgrades, making it a key instrument for community involvement. 
- **Staking:** By staking TLOS, you can earn returns that automatically compounded every 30 minutes. The rewards come from a community reserve and are distributed to those who stake their TLOS.
- **Gas Fees (For Telos EVM):** TLOS is the fuel that powers the Telos Network. To interact with smart contracts, send tokens, and execute transactions, users need to hold TLOS tokens in their wallets. This ensures that the network remains secure and that participants have a stake in its operations.
- **Resource Allocation (For Telos Zero):** TLOS is used to buy network resources so that users may transact, compute, and store data on the Telos chain. To learn more please see [here](../../zero/resource-management/overview)

## Fair Distribution at Launch

In 2018, when the TLOS token was introduced, the network's genesis snapshot was taken from the EOS network. At that time, accounts were limited to a maximum of 40,000 TLOS tokens. This strategic decision aimed to prevent the centralization of ownership among 'whale investors' and ensure a more equitable distribution of the token.
This also means that there are no heavily vested VCs or team funds whoâ€™s tokens will unlock at specific intervals. This wide token distribution ensure that Telos blockchain stays conflict-free community-led effort. More information about the fair distribution model can be found in the original [Telos Whitepaper.](https://telos.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Telos-Whitepaper-master-20180717.pdf)
