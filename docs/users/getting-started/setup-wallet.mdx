# Creating A Wallet

To get started in the Telos ecosystem youâ€™ll need a cryptocurrency wallet. A wallet allows you to securely store your assets and interact with dApps (Decentralized Applications) within the Telos ecosystem.

## Wallet Options

We will be going over three different options for wallets on Telos. Each wallet is recommended based on your experience and comfort level with crypto.

### Telos Cloud Wallet (Telos EVM and Telos Zero)

[Telos Cloud Wallet](users/getting-started/setup-wallet#telos-cloud-wallet) is incredibly easy to use and lets you create a wallet with your existing Google account. Because of its ease of use and the fact that it is compatible with both Telos EVM and Telos Zero, **we recommend it to all new users and beginers.**

### MetaMask (Telos EVM)

[MetaMask](users/getting-started/setup-wallet#metamask) is an industry-standard and is used across all EVMs. **If you have experience in crypto or already use MetaMask**, then this is a great option for you.

### Anchor (Telos Zero)

[Anchor](users/getting-started/setup-wallet#setting-up-a-telos-wallet-account-telos-zero) is the most popular wallet signer for Telos Zero. If you are more **advanced in your crypto knowledge or want to take full advantage of the power that Telos has**, this is a great option for you.
