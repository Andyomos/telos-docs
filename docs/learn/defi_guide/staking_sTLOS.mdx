# Liquid Staking on EVM (sTLOS)

__A guide on how to stake TLOS on EVM for the sTLOS receipt token.__

The sTLOS receipt token is very exciting for the future development of the Telos DeFi ecosystem. sTLOS liquid staking allows you to remain flexible with your investments while enjoying staking rewards.

Once liquidity pairs for sTLOS/TLOS are available on our tEVM exchanges, these can be used to sell sTLOS receipt tokens at a market-determined price.

:::tip
Please be aware that a 10-day unstaking timer is applied when removing your funds from sTLOS liquid staking. Once unstaked and sent to the underlying ESCROW contract, you will no longer be able to sell or transfer your tokens.
:::

---------------

## Purpose

In this guide, we will stake TLOS for sTLOS(receipt token) on [Telos Web Wallet](https://wallet.telos.net/) and [Teloscan](http://teloscan.io).

### Why stake TLOS for sTLOS?

- Staked sTLOS helps you put your staked TLOS to work in Defi and explore additional yield opportunities.
- Helps lock TVL on EVM, enabling more attraction for investors and Dapps building on Telos.

:::tip
Having sTLOS on the tEVM does not allow you to vote in governance processes (including block producers and worker proposals) - these are limited to the Zero Network. Stake on Zero to participate in Defi. Stake on EVM for receipt token and more yield opportunities. It's simple to ask yourself this question: why am I staking? What is my defi play(have a plan), as there is a 3-5 day locking period.
