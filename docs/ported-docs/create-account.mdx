## Method 1: Telos Signup (account creation) + Anchor (signer)

The most preferred method to create a free Telos account and access dApps. 

### Telos Account Signup 

1. Go to the Telos website account creation page [telos.net/signup](https://www.telos.net/signup)
2. You will be taken to a signup screen (If this does not happen, you can access it directly [here](https://app.telos.net/accounts/add)).
3. Click 'Connect Wallet'
4. Click 'Create New Account'
5. Enter a unique 12-character address of your choice. You can use lowercase letters from a-z and numbers from 1-5. (If the address is already taken, try a different one). 
6. Pass the CAPTCHA
7. Click on ‘Create’
8. Once the Account has been created, Telos will generate your unique Private Key. You will need this Private Key to add your Telos account to Anchor in the next step.

:::info
Maintaining 100% control of your Private key is a number 1 priority!  
Write down your Private Key information and store it in a safe place. We recommend that you write it down on a piece of paper instead of copying it to a digital drive as an additional measure of security.
